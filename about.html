                Oftentimes, the coffee beans are known to be of good quality if the bitterness is pleasant, rather than rancid or sharp. Coffee bean quality can also be determined by its color. Unroasted coffee beans, also known as green coffee beans, are somewhat pale, yellowish beige with just a hint of green.

        <h3>WHY SHOULD I SERVE FRESH COFFEE?</h3>
        <article>
            <p>We know that like most fresh produce, the fresher it is, the better it is and that goes for coffee too. We’ve done extensive testing (well, we drank loads of coffee!) and can honestly say that coffee is at its freshest between three and fourteen days after roasting.</p>

            <p>
                After that, it starts to deteriorate slowly. We conclude that coffee is at it’s absolute best within four weeks of being roasted. If for some reason it’s gobbled up in that time, then it’s still good for eight weeks after that.
